# AI-captioning-and-style-prediction
This project uses OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model to predict the aesthetic style of an image and match it with the most relevant captions from a list, based on visual-text similarity. It filters captions by style and ranks them to generate context-aware, visually aligned image descriptions.
